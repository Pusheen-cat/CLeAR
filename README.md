Code for "CLeAR: Continual Learning on Algorithmic Reasoning for Human-like Intelligence" (NeurIPS 2023)

I am currently in the process of cleaning up the code, and my goal is to complete it by the main conference in December. If you urgently need the code, please feel free to contact me via email.
